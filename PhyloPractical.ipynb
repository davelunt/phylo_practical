    "One very useful aspect of using code to carry out analyses is that once you have written it, and it works, its very little effort to re-run it again on any number or any size of other data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I have collected from GenBank whole mitochondrial genomes (about 16,000 nucleotides) from a lot of great apes including humas, neanderthals, and species of gorillas in addition to the species you have just analysed. The file is large but we can just run the same code again. If you want to find out how much data you have, you could insert a cell and paste in the code to quantify sequences (from the ape example) and run it for the big_ape dataset. This is optional. For efficiency reasons I've compressed the code below a little, but its the same as you have just run.\n",
    "\n",
    "This big analysis gives you the opportunity to decide whether the similarity of divergence between groups that you have just observed is true more widely. When the class have produced their big trees we will all discuss what the divergence levels might mean. If you want to find out how much data you are analysing you can copy and paste the \"how much data do you have?\" cell from above, and run it here (on the new fasta file). But that is optional."
